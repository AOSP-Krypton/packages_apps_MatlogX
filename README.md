MatlogX
=========
A graphical log reader for Android.

Based on [Matlog](https://github.com/plusCubed/matlog) but completely rewritten in kotlin, following
the MVVM android design architecture and using jetpack compose for the user interface.

Supports devices running on Android 12 and above.

Overview
---------
MatlogX is a free and open-source material-style log reader for Android based on Matlog.

It shows a scrolling (tailed) view of the Android "logcat" system log, hence the goofy name.
